# Java Testing Exercises – Level 1

## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement

This project contains three Java exercises focused on unit testing using JUnit 5 as part of the Back-End Web Development curriculum.

### Exercise 1: Library Manager
Implement a class that manages a collection of books. It supports adding, retrieving, inserting, and removing books, while maintaining the list sorted alphabetically. All functionality is validated through unit tests.

### Exercise 2: DNI Letter Calculator
Implement a class that calculates the correct letter for a Spanish DNI number. The algorithm is tested using a parameterized JUnit test with a wide range of input cases.

### Exercise 3: Exception Handling
Implement a method that throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. A test ensures that the exception is thrown correctly.
